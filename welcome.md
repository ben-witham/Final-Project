# Welcome

Hello all, thank you for stopping by my data structures tutorial!

## Introduction

This tutorial will go over several different data structures that programmers can use to organize their data. The structures explained in this tutorial are the stack, set, and binary search tree. While this tutorial is done in python, the concepts learned will be the same in other languages, save the syntax. If you need to check the syntax for other languages, I would suggest using w3schools.com to find good tutorials and code snippets that help cement their use.

This tutorial is set up to first explain the structure, then you learn how and when to use them, and finally you attempt it by yourself.
